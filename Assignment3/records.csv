It is particularly rich in:. (a) manuscripts written in Old English; (b) monastic cartularies; (c) saints' Lives; (d) genealogies; (e) histories and chronicles; (f) English state papers; The collection also comprises items made elsewhere in Europe and further afield (including China, Morocco and Turkey). A significant component is the charters, rolls and seals, predominantly from the British Isles, among which are two of the four surviving original copies of Magna Carta. The following Cotton manuscripts were destroyed by fire in 1731 (or in a separate fire at the British Museum bindery in 1865): Galba A. I; Galba A. II; Galba A. III; Galba A. VIII; Otho A.

Sir John Cotton bequeathed his collection of manuscripts to the nation 'for Publick Use and Advantage', as confirmed by Act of Parliament (12 and 13 William III, c. 7). In October 1731, many items in the Cotton collection were damaged by fire while housed at Ashburnham House, London, a handful of volumes being destroyed in their entirety. The Cotton library formed one of the foundation collections of the British Museum in 1753, being incorporated into the British Library in 1973","Three studies are fundamental for the history of the collection: Colin G.

MAGNA CARTA 1225: the exemplification of the Great Charter of Liberties granted by Henry III at Westminster, 11 Feb. 1225, that was sent to the county of Wiltshire and subsequently deposited at Lacock Abbey (see further below). No contemporary enrolment of the charter's text survives, but the Red Book of the Exchequer, in the Public Record Office, contains an early transcript (E. 164/2, ff. 183-184). Two other surviving exemplifications are respectively among the archives of the Duchy of Lancaster preserved in the Public Record Office (D.L. 1O/71) and in those of the Dean and Chapter of Durham at Durham Cathedral (1. 2. Reg. 2); of two further putative exemplifications from Battle Abbey and at Norwich Cathedral, referred to by W. Blackstone, The Great Charter and Charter of the Forest, 1759, p. xlvi, no trace can now be found. Only at Durham is the charter accompanied by an exemplification of the Charter of the Forest, granted by Henry III at the same time. The text of the charter, taken from that of its confirmation by Edward I in 1297, in which form it passed into English law, was first printed by Richard Pynson [ Antiqua Statuta ], 1508 (STC. 9266), ff. 1-7b. The text of the present exemplification, which has certain variant readings, was first printed by Blackstone, op . cit, pp. 47-59, in collation with other texts; that of the Durham exemplification, which has also some variant readings, in Statutes of the Realm, 1810-1828, i, pp. 22-28, with similar collation and a facsimile. Among many subsequent reprints, those of C. Bémont, Chartes des Libertés Anglaises, 1892, pp. 46-60, and W. S. McKechnie, Magna Carta, 2nd ed, 1914, pp. 497-508, indicate its relationship to the earlier charters of liberties granted by King John in 1215, and by Henry III in 1216 and 1217. For the present document, see also Blackstone, op. cit, p. xlvii; A. J. Collins, Notes on the Lacock Abbey Magna Carta Of 1225, 1947; 'The Lacock Abbey Magna Carta', Brit. Mus. Quart. xvi, 1951-1952, pp. 1-2, and plate 1; G. R. C. Davis, Magna Carta, 1963, p. 30, and plate VI. Vellum; 1 membrane. 500 mm. x 320 mm. A.D. 1225. Ruled with a plummet (the ruling being subsequently for the most part erased), and written continuously, 67 lines of text, in a clear Court hand, the opening four words in capital letters, but otherwise without decoration. Written space 460 mm. x 300 mm. An impression, now imperfect, in green wax, of the first Great Seal of Henry III is appended by a plaited green silk cord of four strands, which has round it part of a seal bag of natural coloured silk, stitched along the edge in pale blue, of which another part was retained by the donor and remains at Lacock Abbey; for engravings of the seal in the 18th century, when it was slightly less damaged, see Blackstone, op. cit, pp. 59 (obverse), 67 (reverse). An identificatory endorsement written in contemporary book hand, in two lines along part of the edge of the verso reads: 'Hen(rici) Reg(is) fil(ii) Ioh(annis) Reg(is) de lib(er)tatibus & q(u)ibusda(m) consuetudinibus p(er) Anglia(m) constitut(is).' Above this, another and perhaps slightly later hand has written 'Ex d[e]posito militu(m) Wiltisir'. From the latter endorsement, the document is assumed to have been deposited at Lacock Abbey for safe custody by Ela, Countess of Salisbury, its Foundress in 1232 and Abbess 1239-1257, whose husband William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, had been Sheriff of Wiltshire when it was issued, and who had herself succeeded him in this office 1227-1228 and 1231-1236. In 1759 it was recorded by Blackstone, op. cit, p. xlvii, as in the possession of John Talbot of Lacock, to whom it had presumably descended from Sir William Sharington, purchaser of the Abbey's site in 1540. From John Talbot it passed similarly by descent to the donor, who gives some account of its history in the 20th century and of her gift of it to the British Museum, in My Life and Times at Lacock Abbey, 1956, pp. 188-19O, 255, 259-260.

York, a Royalist prisoner in Durham Castle, circ . 1653-1660. The compilation is dedicated, in a letter (f. 5 b) dated March, 1656, to his son John Gibson. Holograph. He has inserted in the volume about a dozen portraits and other engravings, chiefly taken from books. Joseph Hunter in Add. MS. 24463, f. 59 b sqq , gives particulars of the family from a note-book which belonged to the son. Sir John, who had been captain of the North Riding Horse on the king's side, compounded in 1649 (Cal. Committee for Comp, ii. p. 1906), but seems to have been again imprisoned in 1653. About two-thirds of the volume consists of translations of sermons : 'St. Chrysostome translated into English out of the Greeke by John Errington esq, 1656.' This title on f. 6 is erased. There are thirty sermons by, or attributed to, St. John Chrysostom, with a prefatory letter signed J. E. (erased and J. G. substituted), and one sermon of St. Gregory of Nyssa with similar preface (f. 35) signed J. E. In spite of the title the Chrysostom sermons are undoubtedly taken from the Latin, perhaps Gesenius' edition (Basel, 1547). The translator in perhaps John Errington, of Rudby, another delinquent in the North Riding (Cal. Comm. Comp, iv. P. 2771), and other entries with his name or initials are anagrams, with verses, on the names of Gibson and his; wife Penelope (f. 261) and of John Jopling, keeper of the gaol at Durham (ff. 178 b, 227), and paraphrases from Ecclesiastes and Tobit (ff. 213, 215 b). Gibson's own compositions inclucle a doggerel autobiography (f. 167) and much other versification, chiefly devotional, prayers and notes (one, f. 4 b, in Greek) and a tract, 'Amara ducis, or the bitter-sweete sufferings of the Saints aud servants of God in all ages of the World, written by an old Barzillai banished from his owne Ithica,' with preface signed 'Carolophylos,' and dated 7 Feb. 166.0/1, (f. 273). There are also many letters addressed by him to unnamed friends outside, and a few medical recipes. Gibson's arms are drawn at f. 162 and his motto, 'In infaelicitate faelix,' occurs frequently. He has also drawn (f. 165) a fanciful coat of arms (two legs) with verses dated 1656, at f. 268 b an epitaph for himself, and at f. 161 a sketch of 'The House of my Pilgrimage' [Durham Castle?]. Among miscellaneous extracts and historical notes interspersed are:-. 1. Brief excerpts from Jeremy Taylor's works. ff. 4 b, 123 b, 155 b, 282 b. 2.

Whittlesey, who was also the author, and possibly the illuminator, of a ' cronica rotulata ' containing a pedigree of the Kings of England to the death of Edward I, with additions, described in The Ancestor, xi (Oct. 1904), pp. 158-160, appears to have been alive in 1319, when a Papal indult to choose a confessor was granted to ' Walter de Witlesey, monk of Peterborough,' see Calendar of Papal Registers, 1342 - 1362, p. 330. Contents :-. 1. Dates, not in strictly chronological order, of:-. -(a) Foundations of fifty-six religious houses, chiefly in England; -(b) Obits of English Kings to Edw. II; -(c) English battles and other historical events; -(d) Obits, etc, of Saints. The latest entry refers to the Battle of Poitiers, 1356. A transcript of the first of these lists, with extracts from other parts of the MS, by Robert Glover, Somerset Herald, is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (Ashmole MS. 848, ff. 10-18 b), cf.

Collectanea, iii (1770), p. 31) was apparently that in the burnt Cotton MS, from which the present text was probably taken. Selden, following Camden and Stowe, in his notes to Drayton's Poly-Olbion, 1612, p. 188, attributes the Passion to Robert de Swapham; but there is no copy of it in Swapham's MS. (see below). f. 8. 3.

The life of Hereward, inserted at f. 46 b. is apparently abridged from the ' Gesta Herwardi ' (ff. 320-339 in Robert de Swapham's MS. in the Library of Peterborough Cathedral), printed by C. T.

Sparke in Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores Varii, 1723, where this text is collated with a transcript of the Cotton MS, then belonging to Bridges (but apparently not among his MSS. now at Oxford), and with Swapham's MS, variant readings being noted at the foot of each page. Gunton and Patrick's Hist. of the Church of Peterborough, 1686, is little more than a running analysis of the chronicle so far as it goes; Gunton used this text, cf. ibid , p. 47, while Patrick relied on Swapham's MS. Transcripts of the MSS. of Candidus and Swapham are in Lansdowne MSS. 992, 994 and in MS. Dd. 14, 28, in the Cambridge University Library. Prologue beg. ' Scripturus de loco qui quondam Medeshamstede nunc autem consuete Burch uocatur.' Text, ' Est nobile monasterium in regione Gyruiorum.' f. 20. 5.

II [1321]. Written in the margins of an extent of the manors, etc, of the abbey of the same date, which concludes Whittlesey's part of the chronicle. Printed by Sparke, ibid , pp. 175-216, in parallel columns with the extent. f. 116. 6. Papal privileges of the abbey from Pope Eugenius III, A.D. 1146 (Jaffé, Regesta, ii, 1888, no. 8965), in the original hand to Boniface VIII (A.D. 1295/6 continued in another hand (f. 179 b) to Innocent VI, A.D. 1360, reference being made at the beginning to a (spurious) charter of Pope Agatho, A.D. 680, which is included in the chronicle (f. 25 b). Other copies, apparently from the same source, of the charters on ff. 161-168, 183 b are in Egerton MS. 2733, ff. 107-124, 144 b. Some are printed in Sparke, pp. 78, 92, Dugdale, pp. 390, 391, 393, and Gunton and Patrick, pp. 129, 161. The pages have been scribbled over and the word ' Papa ' erased. f. 161. 7.

Charters on ff. 193-199, 206, 215 b. 216, 219, 230, 229 b, 237 b, 238, 247, 258, 259 b are printed in Gunton and Patrick, pp. 117-168 passim. Some are in Dugdale, pp. 377, 382, 383, 390, 391, 392, and in Sparke, pp. 20, 25, 26. At the end (f. 279) a later hand has added ' Carta Willelmi Humez de Stanford,' 1 May 1172. f. 193. 9. Proceedings at eyres in various counties, 1329-1333. Mainly in Latin .

Gatherings of 12 leaves (i 7, viii 13, xiii 8, xvii 8, xxv 6, xxvi 7, xxvii 6, xxviii 5) with catchwords. F. 20, reproduced by Sparke, op. cit , p. 1, is illuminated in the East Anglian style with a three-parts border and a large initial S, containing Christ with orb in the upper compartment, and in the lower a black monk (Walter de Whittlesey), with scroll inscribed ' misere[re] me,' adoring the Virgin and Child; in the lower margin are three cartouches enclosing figures probably to be identified as the children of Penda, King of the Mercians and legendary co-founders of Peterborough Abbey, viz:-. (i) SS. Kyneburga and Kyneswida, successive Abbesses of Caistor or Dormancaster, co. Northt, (ii) Peada, (iii) Wulfhere and St. Ethelred, successive Kings of the Mercians.

Original binding of oak boards covered with white skin stained pink. The MS. is annotated in various hands, some of which appear also in Egerton MS. 2733. On f. 8 is the name (early 16th cent.) Edwardus Grenehall, and the entry 'Exhibitum in Ecclesia parochiali de Burgo Sancti Petri in presencia mei Nicholai Trygge ' [? alderman of Stamford, co. Linc, circ . 1503 - 1514; see Letters and Papers, Hen. VIII, i (1509-1514), no. 5309; Cal. of Pat. Rolls, Hen. VII, ii (1494-1509), p. 358, etc.]. Belonged to Walter de Whittlesey (cf. the 14th cent. inscriptions on f. 1 b : ' Walterus de Wytillesey,' possibly autogr, and ' Iste liber fuit quondam fratris Walteri de Wytlese ').

COLLECTIONS OF SIR ROBERT COTTON relating to the Courts of Chancery and Requests; 1433-temp. James I. Miscellaneous transcripts, excerpts, etc, in English, Latin, and French, similar in content for the Court of Chancery (artt. 1-16) to those found in, e.g, Stowe MS. 415, Hargrave MSS. 227, 249, and for the dependence of which upon Lambarde see Paul L. Ward, 'William Larnbarde's Collections on Chancery', Harvard Library Bulletin, vii, 1953, pp. 271-298. The texts of many of the ordinances, etc, are printed from elsewhere by G. W. Sanders, Orders of the High Court of Chancery, 1845. The material for the Court of Requests (artt. 17-22) is transcribed in Add. MS. 25248, ff. 1-60, which also belonged to Cotton, and this has largely been printed by I. S. Leadam, Select Cases in the Court of Requests, Selden Soc, xii, 1898, pp. xxxv-cvii passim (cf. also Add. MS. 25246, Hargrave MSS. 165, 240, etc). The Chancery material was presumably intended as source material for Cotton's treatise on the Court of Chancery, of which MS. versions are in Add.

(5) Woodcuts of English royal seals, coins, and coats of arms, Edgar-James I; early 17th cent. Printed on one side of a series of sheets numbered at the foot 26- 42, except the last half sheet (f. 61 b), which is unnumbered. The sheets are now stuck together by the blank sides in pairs, with many of the reproductions of coins excised. The same designs, with occasional minor differences, and with attribution to Christopher Switzer, appear in J. Speed, History of Great Britaine, 1611, pp. 369-883 passim, cf. A. M. Hind, Engraving in England, i, 1952, pp. 228-229; the models for many of the coins were provided by Cotton (see his correspondence with Speed in Cotton MS. Julius C. iii, ff. 354-358, printed by Sir H. Ellis, Original Letters of Literary Men, Camden Soc, xxiii, 1843, pp. 108-112). For other copies of these woodcuts see Cotton MS.

Written in a fine small charter hand. Endorsed 13th century, 'Articuli magne carte libertatum sub sigillo Regis Johannis' and a pressmark 'Johannes XXX' (altered from XXIX) of the archives of the Archbishops of Canterbury. For the text of the document, and hypotheses concerning its composition and dating, see Holt, Magna Carta (2nd edn, 1992), pp. 429-40, and Collins, 'The Documents of the Great Charter of 1215'. The damaged impression of the Great Seal of King John, in white wax, was preserved separately from the 19th century until 2015, since the parchment tag attaching it to a fold in the foot of the document had broken. The seal has now been reattached","Origin: England, possibly Runnymede (Surrey). Provenance: (1) Endorsed with the descriptive title, 13th century, 'Articuli magne carte libertatum sub sigillo Regis Johannis' and a pressmark 'Johannes XXX' (altered from XXIX) of the archives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, in which it was presumably placed by Archbishop Stephen Langton (1207-28). In the archives (which were then at St Gregory's Priory, Canterbury) the royal charters were arranged by sovereigns and stored in vasa . From a mid-13th century register of the archiepiscopal muniments, now Lambeth Palace Library MS 1212, it appears that the document was no. XXX in vase quinto. . (2) Said to have been removed from Lambeth Palace, with other papers, by John Warner, Bishop of Rochester (1638-66), after Archbishop Laud's impeachment in 1640. (3) After Warner's death in 1666, it passed to his nephew John Lee (afterwards Lee-Warner), Archdeacon of Rochester, then to his son, Col. Henry Lee-Warner. (4) Presented by Col. Henry Lee-Warner to Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury (1689-1715). (5) Passed either from Burnet's son-in-law David Mitchell (husband of Mary Burnet and executor of her brother Sir Thomas, d. 1753), or from his grand-daughter Mary Mitchell, into the possession of Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl Stanhope (b. 1714, d. 1786).

Forty-five tinted drawings illustrating the Vita Offarum (ff. 2r-25r). Spaces were left for large illustrations at the top of each leaf. Matthew Paris illuminated the first scenes (ff. 2v-4v) and another St Albans artist completed two drawings (ff. 4v, 5r). In the late 14th century a St Albans artist finished the project based on the instructions left by Matthew Paris in the lower margins. The subject of the illustrations are as follows:. f. 2r: Two courtiers encouraging King Warmund to abdicate. f. 2v: Offa cured of his blindness, both courtiers abandon king Warmund. f. 3r: Offa is given arms. f. 3v: Offa defeating the younger son of Riganus. f. 4r: Offa defeating the elder son of Riganus. f. 4v: Offa burying the dead. f. 5r: Warmund receiving his son and lords, and giving homage to Offa. f. 102v: Frederick II's coat of arm with the rubric 'Testamentum Frederici' referring to Frederick II's will. f. 112r: A drawing of Magna Carta. f. 122r: A seal of the Hospitalers in the lower margin. f. 146r: Gems and rings of the Treasury of St Albans.

Matthew Paris drew a portrait of each abbot the subject of his Gesta abbatum monasterii Sancti Albani . There are 24 coloured portraits of abbots, each framed with red, green or yellow ink. Only the abbot 'Leofric' was treated in a different way, shown standing in the margin, wearing a mitre and holding a cross: Matthew mistakenly wrote that Abbot Leofric was elected archbishop of Canterbury (confusing him with Ælfric, d. 1005). The compilation of documents written by Matthew Paris and by other St Albans scribes contains 5 marginal drawings, 3 folios of coat of arms, 3 maps, 3 diagrams and a full-folio of an apocalyptic Christ drawn by the English Franciscan William the Englishman, a contemporary to Matthew Paris (see Susan Lewis, The Art of Matthew Paris (1987), pp. 467-68).

Two charters relating to property of John Payn, citizen and armourer of London, viz. (a) Feoffment by Payn to Thomas de Carleton, citizen of London, Alban, parson of the church of Hadham [co. Hertf.], and four others of the manors of Southall [South Hall], in Reynham [Rainham] and Wenington [Wennington], and Magna Warle [Great Warley], and lands in Rainham, Wennington, Warley, and Brighous [Bridge House in Upminster], co. Essex; the feoffees to re-convey the premises in fee tail to Johanna, wife of the said John Payn, and her heirs by John Payn. Dat. Saturday after the feast of St. Peter ad Vincula [4 Aug.], 49 Edw. III [1375]. Lat . f. 80; (b) Conveyance of the same manors to Johanna Payn as provided by the preceding charter. Date omitted, but after the death of John Payn, who d. in 49 Edw. III (Inquis. post Mortem, iii, 1821, p. 178). Lat . f. 79 b. 37. Form of writ of summons to the Court of Chancery, without names. Lat. f. 80 b. 38. Account of the coronation of Richard I: the narrative of Hoveden (Chronica Mag. Rog. de Hovedene, ed. Stubbs, Rolls Series, 1870, iii, p. 8, 'Deinde idem, dux,' p. 13, 'perpetuam eleemosynam'), but prefaced by a short passage (9 lines), not from Hoveden, summarizing events between Henry II's death and Richard's arrival in England. Beg. 'Mortuo Rege Henrico.' f. 81. 39. Moral verses (6 lines), beg. 'Vir vidias (sic) quid iubeas dum magnus haberis Respicias ne despicias quem ledere queris.' f. 82 b. 40. 'De Londoniis fama' : considerable portions of the account of London in Fitzstephen's Vita Sancti Thomas (J. C. Robertson, Mat . for the Hist. of Thomas Becket, Rolls Series, 1877, iii, p. 2, etc.), but arbitrarily arranged. The text agrees more nearly with that contained in the Liber Custumarum (H. T. Riley, Munimenta Gildhallae Londoniensis, Rolls Series, 1859-1862, vol. ii, pt. i, p. 2), than with that given by Robertson, but it contains some noticeable variations from both and, apparently, from all published texts. The extracts are carelessly copied. Beg. 'Inter nobiles vrbes orbis.' f. 83. 41. Charter of Henry III to London for the election of the Mayor; 18 Feb. a 0 11 [1227]. In Lib. Cust. (op. cit. p. 45). Lat . f. 85. 42. 'De libertatibus Londoniarum de tempore sancti Edwardi Regis' : an extract from the article 'De heretochiis' in the later version of the so-called 'Leges Edwardi Confessoris' (Liebermann, Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen, i, p. 657). The same passage also occurs in the Liber Albus (Riley, op. cit. i, p. 498). The text of the present MS. bears the closest resemblance to that of Oriel MS. 46; as it agrees in the accidental omission of the clause 'et ... Troie,' it seems likely that it may have been copied from it, or that both were copied from a common original. Beg. 'Sicut continet (sic) in lege . . . debet in Londoniis.' f. 85. 43. William the Conqueror's first charter to London; Engl , with translations into the Engl. current in A.D. 1314 and into Lat . The charter, with the same translations, occurs in Lib. Cust. p. 246, but there are differences of reading which show that the present copy cannot have been taken from that MS. f. 85 b. 44. Henry I's charter to London; Rymer, Foedera, 1816, i, p. 11. f. 86. 45. Henry II's charter to London; Lib. Cust. p. 31. f. 86 b. 46. Richard I's first charter to London, 23 April, a o 5 [1194]; Lib. Cust. p. 248. f. 87. 47. John's third charter to London, 5 July, a o 1 [l199]; Lib. Cust. p. 249. f. 87 b. 48. The operative part (beg. 'Nos autem donaciones') of the Inspeximus charter of Edw. III to London, 26 May, a o 15 [1341]; Lib. Cust. p. 443. f. 88. 49. 'De principio aldermannorum et qualiter receperunt nomina sua' : extract from the 'Lecres Edwardi Confessoris,' later version (Liebermann, op. cit. pp. 654-656). The same extract is also given in Lib. Cust. pp. 634-637. Beg. 'Greiue quoque nomen.' f. 88 b. 50. Documents conneeted with the eyre at the Tower of London, 14 Edw. II [1321]. For similar and much fuller collections see Lib. Cust. pp. 285-432, Placita de Quo Warranto, pp. 445-474; but the present MS. contains some items not in the two referred to. The documents are: (a) Writ of the King to the sheriffs, to make proclamation ordering attendance at the eyre, 20 Nov. a o 14 [1320] Lib. Cust. p. 285, Placita, p. 448. Lat. . f. 90; (b) Return by the sheriffs to the preceding writ; Lib. Cust. p. 290. Lat. f. 90b; (c) Proclamation by the sheriffs in accordance with the writ, Sunday, feast of St. Andrew [Nov. 30, 1320]. Fr . f. 91; (d) 'Nomina maiorum, vicecomitum, aldirmannorum, camerariorum, et coronatorum ciuitatis ab vltimo itinere iusticiariorum apud Turrim Londoniarum a o . regni regis Edwardi filii regis Henrici. quarto vsque ad festum Sancti Hillarii [13 Jan.] a o . regni regis Edwardi filii regis Edwardi xiiii[1275-1321].' Similar lists, but not including the aldermen, in Lib. Cust . p.291, Placita, pp. 446-447. The present lists are abbreviated, only the first few names of each being given. f. 92; (e) 'Modus et ordo qualiter barones et vniuersitas ciuium Londoniarum se debent habere et gerere erga dominum regem et iusticiarios suos tempore quo domino rege (sic) placuerit tenere placita corone sue apud Turrim London. de attachiamentis et infortunis (sic) in eadem ciuitate emersis.' Lib. Alb. pp. 51-60; also in the 318. of Lib. Cust. and in Add. 1518. 37791, ff. 17-21. The present text shows some differences. f. 92 b. 51.

Alb. p. 577, Lib. Cust. pp. 116-117. So too in Add. MS. 37791, ff. 32-34b, but that MS. adds the remaining regulations. f. 106. 60. 'Capitula dicenda pistoribus in halimoto suo.' Lib.

'Assisa panis et seruicie in ciuitatibus, burgis, et extra burgos per vniuersam regionem Anglie' : in the main the ordinance printed in Stat. i, p. 179, but with very considerable differences in wording. f. 116. 68.

Between the articles 'quod arestati' and 'de batellariis' (Lib. Alb. p. 277) it inserts, without heading, the article 'de countours et attournes' given in Lib. Cust. pp. 280-282, but in a somewhat different text. Fr. f. 120. 76.

At the beginning (ff. 3-9) is a table of the chapters of many of the statutes included, and on the blank leaves before and after this a number of miscellaneous entries have been added, as follows: (a) Mnemonic verses, viz.: 'C ter erat mille decies sex unus et ille Luce tua Maure uchemens fuit impetus aure' (great storm, 15 Jan. 1361); 'H. patre subiuncto post R. reget I. que relicto E. post H. fiet rex E. post E. postea mira' (Hen.

Gatherings normally of 12 leaves, but the first two of 2 and 8 respectively, one (ff. 90-100) of 11, and one (ff. 71-89) of 19 owing to the insertion of a gathering of 8 leaves in one of 11. Names of former owners are : Richard Drax (15-16th cent, f. 2 b) and (f. 1) John Maynard of the Middle Temple [Sir John Maynard, Serjeant-at-law, First Commissioner of the Great Seal, 1690]. A note by Sir Thomas Phillipps on f. 1 states that the MS. was bought at Sir Gregory Osborne Page-Turner's sale, March, 1827, and on ff. i, 1 are numbers, 742 / 3 and 2718 / 3, the former of which is stated to be the sale numer at the Page-Turner sale and the latter a 'N o in some. prior sale.' There was a Page-Turner sale in October, 1824, and in the sale-catalogue this MS. is the third of lot 2718. The number 742 / 3 seems, therefore, to refer to a subsequent sale in March, 1827. Perhaps part of the collection was withdrawn in 1824 and offered again in 1827: cf. Add. MS. 35094 (acquired by Sir T. Phillipps in March, 1827), which also belonged both to Sir John Maynard and to Sir G. 0. Page-Turner, and which has the double numeration 2713 / 3 (1824 sale?) and 737 / 3 ; Eg. MS. 2811 has the entry, by Sir T. Phillipps, 'Bought at Sir G. P. Turner's Sale, March 1827. 'Phillipps MS. 3106 (sale-cat. 1911, lot 336). Sir T. Phillipps's crest is stamped on f. 1.

Edw. I, doubtless compiled for use in Lincolnshire. Contents: 1. 'Registrum': a register of writs in the name of Edward I, and evidently compiled in the first years (1272-1275) of his reign, since the formulae of the writs of De nativo habendo and Mort d'ancestor (ff. 13, 23 b) are those in use before the First Statute of Westminster. Cf. Egerton MS. 656, and see F. W. Maitland in Harvard Law Review, iii, 1890, p. 212. The principal divisions are (a) Writ of Right group. f. 1; (b) Ecclesiastical group, beg. 'Quot modis breuia de aduocacionibus ecclesiarum debeant fieri consequenter dicetur.' f. 6 b; (c) Replevin group, ending with the writ De odio et atia, which is ascribed to J. de Lessigton [Lexington]. In the writ De nativo habendo (f. 13) the limitation is 'post vltimum reditum domini I. regis patris nostri de Hybernia,' etc. f. 11; (d) Criminal group. f. 13 b; (e) Miscellaneous group, beg. with De corredio subtracto recuperando. f. 14 b; (f) Account. f. 16; (g) Easements group, beg. with De auxilio habendo ad primogenitum filium militem faciendum. f. 16; (h) Mesne group. f. 18; (i) Customs and services. f. 18 b; (k) Covenant and fine. f. 19; (l) Wardship. f. 19 b; (m) Dower. f. 20; (n) De attornato faciendo, etc. f. 20 b; (o) Novel disseisin, with limit 'post primam transfretacionem nostram in Britanniam.' f. 21b; (p) Mort d'ancestor group, with limitation as in the De nativo. The Besaiel is attributed to Walter of Merton. f. 23 b; (q) Quare ejecit (attributed to Walter of Merton) and Escheat. f. 25 b; (r) Entry and formedon. f. 26; (s) Miscellaneous group, beg. with De custodia priori et conuentui concessa per finem, and including petition and congé d'élire, etc, for W[illiam] de C[olern], Abbot of Malmesbury, letter to the Archbishop for confirmation of W[alter] Giffard, Bishop of Bath and Wells [1264], pardons, grants of franchises (one to Thomas de Wesenham, the King's surgeon), a special writ for R[obertl de erwick impleaded in the court of William de Braose [at Bramber], note 'de anno bisextili pro languidis,' mutatio justiciarii in the assisa utrum, several prohibitions and protections, letter to the Dominican general chapter at Stamford asking prayers for the King, and Queen, etc. f. 27 b; (t) Municipal group, comprising writs relating to disputes between citizens of Oxford and dwellers in the suburbs about talliage, disputes between the towns of Lincoln and Louth, and between the Abbot and gild of Bury St. Edmunds and tenants in the town. f. 32 b; (u) Civil disturbances, the Provisions of Oxford, etc. f. 33; (v) Jewry and debts to the King. f. 33b; (w) Wardship, additional writs. f. 34 b; (x) Trespass (very few). f. 35; (y) Miscellaneous, chiefly administrative, including Darrein Presentment in time of legal vacation, inquest as to Nottingham custom for pre-emption by right heirs, appointment and association of justices, certificate of casual mutilation of an ear, exhibition in an abbey school, debts due to Crusaders, certiorari, collection of a twentieth, etc. f. 35. The collection ends with the Statutum de Iudaeis (f. 38), here dated 25 July, 51 Hen. III, but in the Patent Roll 55 Hen. III [1271], printed in Foedera, Record ed. i, p. 489; followed by a supersedeas for a suit of over 40s. in the bailiff's court at Lincoln. 2. 'Ci comencent diuers cas demandes e aprise et assoines dones en la court le Rey' : a legal treatise of which other copies are in Royal MS. 9 A. vii, f. 190, and Harley MS. 746, f. 100. The texts differ. The judges quoted here are John de Cobham (probably the elder of the name, d. after 1250), Henry de Ba[thonia] and Roger de Thurkilby (both d. about 1260), and Simon de Wauton (Bishop of Norwich in 1257). Beg. '[E]n quant poinz passe le bref de mort de ancestre le bref de nouele desseysine'; ends 'pur ceo quil ne pot demande[r] veue sur nun certein.' f. 38 b. 3. 'Hic demonstrat quot modis essonia sunt calumpnianda, quibus sciliect casibus non iacent': a brief summary of the law of essoins, cf. Royal MS. 9 A. vii, f. 200, Statutes of the Realm, i, p. 217. Beg 'Non iacet quia terra capta est in manu domini regis.' f. 43. 4. 'Veredictum regis Francie' : the Mise of Amiens, morrow of St. Vincent, 'm o . cc o . lxx o . tercio' (sic for 23 Jan. 126). Printed in Foedera, i, p. 433. The preamble is abridged. For another copy see Royal MS. 10 B. vi, f. 132. f. 43 b. 5. Documents relating to the Battle of Lewes, viz. (a) Letter of the Barons to the King, [12 May, 1264]; (b) The King's answer, 12 May, 48 Hen. III [1264]; (c) Letter of defiance of the King of the Romans, Prince Edward and the Barons to the King, [same date]. All these are printed in Foedera, i, p. 440, and for other copies see Royal MSS. 5 F. xv, f. 2 b, 8 D. iii, f. 164 b, etc. f. 44; (d) 'De bello de Lewes' : a brief account of the result of the battle, with lists of prisoners and killed. Beg. 'Vt sciatis autem de processu belli habiti apud Lewes.' f. 44; (e) 'Ordinacio status regni apud London' : the document printed at the end of the Act of Parliament of 1264 in Foedera, i, p. 443. Beg. 'Ordinatum est quod status ecclesie Anglicane in statum debitum reformetur.' f. 44 b. 6. 'De manerio extendendo' : not the Extenta manerii of Stat. Realm, i, p. 242, but a briefer summary, incompletely copied. Beg. 'Ad manerium extendendum primo eligentur xii homines . . . ab hiis inquirendum est de redditu assiso'; ends 'quantum terre quisque teneat et per quod seruicium et per que.' f. 45. 7. 'De officio coronatoris' : differing somewhat from the text printed from Harley MS. 667 in Stat. Realm, i, p. 40, and having no mention of wreck of the sea. Beg. 'In principio hec inquirenda sunt a coronatore domini regis: inprimis quod cum ipsi coronatores habuerint mandatum.' f. 45 b. 8. 'Acopement de mort de home' : a formula including a date 13 Edw, which may be that of the scribe, who has apparently an affection for the number 13, see in art. 1 (compiled certainly before 1275) the date of the petition for election of an abbot of Malmesbury given on f. 28 as 12 Mar. 13 Edw, which cannot be right (the true date is 44 Hen. III, see Harley MS. 6957, f. 69), and again in art. 9 in forms on ff. 57 b-59 b. Beg. 'Ce vus mustl.e W. le fuiz W.' f. 46. 9. 'Registre' (so catchword, no title) : a form of the treatise known as Brevia Placitata, other copies of which are in Add. MS. 5762, f. 111, Harley MSS. 409, f. 97, 1120, f. 153, Egerton MS. 656, f. 165, etc. The first form of writ is dated 2 May, 1 Edw, but the date 13 Edw. also occurs, see above. The first comment beg. (f. 47 b) '[O]re fet a resortir au primer bref que plus est comun.' Introduced near the end (f. 61 b) are some pleadings concerning the manor of Gainsborough between William de Valence and the Stutevilles after the death of G[erard] Talbot. Ends 'En checun bref de fine fete quant ele est freint pot home counter par meime la fourme.' f. 47. 10. 'Hic incipit quedam summa quam dominus Radulphus de Hengham fecit conpendiose de breuibus et placitis in curia domini regis the treatise known as Magnum (or Magna) Hengham, compiled by Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench 1274-1289 and of the Common Pleas 1301-1307 (d. 1311). Printed by Selden with Fortescue's De Laudibus Legum Angliae, 1616. Beg. '[L]icet ordo placitandi in curia domini regis'; ends 'perenptorie descinditur actio actoris.' f. 62 b. After art. 10 three blank leaves (completing the 7th quire) have been cut out. Artt. 1-10 are apparently in one hand (see also end of art. 27). 11. 'Westmoster' (in another hand 'premer') the First Statute of Westminster, 22 Apr. 1275. French. Printed in Stat. Realm, i, p. 26. f. 74. 12. 'Les estatuz nostre seianur le rey Edward de la Iurie fez a la seint Michel en lan de son regne terz' [Michaelmas, 1275] : the Statute of Jewry. Printed with many variants ib. p. 221, as of uncertain date. At the end, without fresh heading, follow the paragraphs known as Districtiones Scaccarii (ib. p. 197). Colophon, 'Ci finisent les estatuz de la Iurie.' f. 81. 13. 'Les articles que touchent la Iurie a enquere.' Not printed in Stat. Realm . Beg. '[D]e Jeus fausers e retondors de la monoye.' f. 82. 14. 'Les estatuz le rey Edward fez a Gloucestre' : the Statute of Gloucester [7 Aug. 1278], with the abridged form of preamble. Printed ib. p. 45. f. 82 b. 15. 'Les estatuz sur le rageman': the Statute De justiciariis assignatis, Michaelmas, 4 Edw. I [l276]. Printed ib. p. 44. f. 84 b. 16. 'Les estatuz de religions': De viris religiosis [7 Edw. I, 15 Nov. 1279]. French. Printed in Latin, ib. p. 51. f. 85. 17. 'La grant charre le rey Henri de franchises' : the form of excommunication against violators of Magna Carta and Carta de Foresta pronounced by the Archbishop of Canterbury and prelates at Westminster, 15[?12] May, 1253. French. Printed in Latin in Foedera, i, p. 289. Followed by a French translation of Magna Carta [as confirmed in 36 Hen. III, 11 Feb. 125 1 / 2, see Stat. Realm, i (charters), p. 28]. f. 85 b. 18. 'La chartre de la forest' : French tranlation of Carta de Foresta as confirmed 2 Hen. III, 6 Nov [1217], cf. ib. p. 20. f. 88 b. 19. 'Les purueances de Merton' : French version of the Provisions of Merton, 20 Hen. III [23 Jan. 1236]. Cf. ib. p. 1. f. 90. 20. 'Les purueances de Marleberge': French version of the Statute of Marlborough, 52 Hen. III, 18 Nov. 1267. The Latin text of one clause is given in the margin. Cf. ib. p. 19. f. 91 b. 21. 'Lestatuz de Atton Burnel' : the Statute of Acton Burnell or De mercatoribus, 11 Edw. I, 12 Oct [1283]. Printed ib. p. 53. f. 95 b. 22. 'Ceo fet asauer' : the common treatise known as Fet asaver. Printed by G. E. Woodbine, Four Thirteenth Century Law Tracts, Yale and Oxford, 1910. Beg. '[C]eo fet asauer que au comencement de checun ple'; ends with the writs in plea of trespass. The writs are translated into French and contain the initials of G[ilbert] de P[reston] as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas [ circ. 1269-1274], and one (f. l00b) is addressed by Edw. I to R[ichard de Gravesend, d. 1279], Bishop of Lincoln. f. 96b. 23. '[C]es sunt les iugemenz des essoignes, e ci pot home aprendre coment home se deit contenir en plai' : a French form of the treatise (sometimes attributed to Ralph de Hengham or to John de Mettingham) called Judicium Essoniorum. The text however differs very considerably from the Latin as given in Harley MS. 1120, f. 112, Royal MS. 9 A. vii, f. l12, etc. A nearer Latin text is given by Add. MS. 5762, f. 65 b, Egerton MS. 656, f. 205; cf. the text printed by Woodbine, op. cit. p. 116. From the Egerton MS. it would seem that the tract had originally the form of answers to a set of questions addressed to a judge. Beg. 'En comensement de tuz plez la ou essoignes gisent'; ends 'sicum les autres que cheront deuant iustices erranz ou deuant iustices du bane.' f. 106. 24. 'De warantizacione carte et quis tenetur warantizare' : a few miscellaneous legal notes, beg. '[D]e warantizacione carte et quis tenetur warantizare et quid de iure quando vnus vel plures maiores vel minores vocantur ad warantum. Notandum diuersis modis possunt aliqui.' f. 110. On a blank space on f. 111 are added in another hand the 'Explanaciones super quibusdam articulis statuti de Gloucestre' (see art. 14), printed in Stat. Realm, i, p. 50. 25. Reports of cases (about 26), whether strictly speaking a Year-book, i.e. cases of a particular term or terms, or a collection made from various terms, does not appear. Some of the cases must be of a date between 1272 and 1277 (see f. 113b, where the Queen of Almain [Beatrice, widow of Richard, Earl of Cornwall] is a plaintiff). A regular Year-book of this date would perhaps be the earliest yet discovered. The chief names of judges and counsel occurring are Alan of Walkingham, Gilbert de Thornton, John Giffard, John de Cave, John le Koy, Martin [of Littlebury?], R. de Boyland, Sire Ells [de Beckingham?], John de Mettingham and R[alph] de Freningham. Beg. '[N]ichole de Berkelee prist femme. apres morut Nichol sanz esperance de heir'; ends 'quil certifiast la court etc. Teste magistro R. de Freningham.' f. 111 b. 26. 'Les reulles sein Robert,' beg. '[C]i comencent les reulles que le bon euesque de Nicholc sein Robert fist a la contesse de Nichole de garder et de gouerner terres osteus. Qui les reulles voudra tenir, ben e bel del soen viure porra, e sei meimes e les soens sustenir': twenty-eight rules for the economical management of an estate. The tract is printed from Harley MS. 273, f. 81, Add. MS. 5762, f. 136, and other MSS. by Miss E. Lamond with Walter of Henley's Husbandry (1890). If the attribution is true, the rules were probably drawn for Margaret, wife of John de Lacy, 1st Earl of Lincoln, who was left a widow in 1240, her son being then about thirteen. She married Walter Marshal, Farl of Pembroke, about Jan. 1243. The first rule beg. 'La primere reulle enseigne coment seignur ou dame porra sauer en checun maner totes les terres;' the last ends 'en Lindeseye en Norfoukes e en le val de Beauer e en ceu pais vos robes achatez a seint Iue.' f. 118 b. 27. 'La manere de pleder en Nichole' : rules of the city court of Lincoln, relating chiefly to pleas of assault or debt. A defendant, if a man, has the choice of compurgation 'quasi Gallicus' with two compurgators, here called 'wachtesmunes' ('wahtes,' 'whacti'), or 'quasi Anglicus' with eleven. If a woman, she must defend in the English fashion. Beg. ' n primis sciendum est quod placita ciuitatis'; ends 'per iudicium curie abibit, similiter et conquestor, etc.' f. 121 b. Artt. 11-27 appear to be in one hand, which is perhaps the same as that of artt. 1-10. Art. 28 may be also in the same hand, but seems to be a later addition. 28. 'Kaernaruan. Cos sunt les articles purueuz de la moneye de Engletere a Kaernaruan par nostre seingnur le rey Edward e son conseil lan de son regne douzime': the Statutum de Moneta of 12 Edw. I [29 Sept. 1284], incomplete, the first three paragraphs only. Printed in Stat. Realm, i, p. 219. f. 123 b. At the end is a note in a minute band on dower. Art. 29 is in another hand. 29. 'Noua statuta edita apud Westmonasterium ad Pascha anno regni regis Edwardi terciodecimo' (so colophon) : the Second Statute of Westminster [after Easter, 1285] in French, including art. xlix, which does not occur in the Latin, see Stat. Realm, i, p. 71. f. 124. At the end, in the same minute hand as the note on f. 123 b, is copied (f. 139 b) a portion of the Statute of Winchester [13 Edw. 1]. On the vellum fly-leaves are: (a) Contemporary note of the absence of Edward I abroad for three years from Easter [really from 13 May], 17 (sic for 14) Edw [1286] to 15 [really 12] Aug. 17 Edw [1289]. f. 142; (b) 'Assisa panis' (et cervisie), in a late 13th cent. band. Nearly as in Stat. Realm, i. p. 199. f. 142; (c) Form of proxy for litigation, in 4 hand of the first half of the 14th cent. f. 141 b; (d) Latin verses on the numerical values (in some cabbalistic system of the kind known as gematria ?) of the letters of the alphabet. In a hand of about the same period. Another copy is in Sloane MS. 297, f. 9. Beg. 'A capud est. numerum quingentos iungere debes.' f. 141 b; (e) Memoranda of farm accompts in several 14th cent. hands, relating to Glaston, co. Rutl, and the neighbourhood. ff. 142 b-143 b. Vellum (except ff. i-vi); ff. vi + 143. 9 1 / 4 in. x 6 1 / 4 in. Circ. A.D. 1285. Gatherings of 12 leaves (iv l0, vii 3, ix 16, xii 8, xiii 7), with catchwords. Sec. fol. 'in eadem.' Initials not inserted. On f. 141 is scribbled the name of an early 16th cent. owner (?) 'Reynold Mohun off the comte of Cornewale esqueyer bedfelow wnto master Denssell in Lyncons Yn.' This is probably a member of the Boconnoc family (see Vivian's Visitations of Cornwall, p. 324), either the Sir.Reginald, of Hall, who was aged about 8 in 1517, or his uncle Reginald, 4th son of John Mohun who died in 1508. A John Densell occurs in 1514 in Letters and Papers, Hen. VIII, i. 5656, and a J. Densell as counsel in the Henry VIII Yearbooks, see Foss, Judges of England, v, p. 107. The MS. afterwards belonged to Sir Thomas Phillipps, MS. 9301 (sale-cat. 1897, lot 291). Dunn sale-cat. 1914, lot 1.547. Manuscripts, Dated (to A.D. 1500): Latin and Modern Languages: A.D 1285.

Royal MS 8 F VII","","","English","THEOLOGICAL TRACTS, in Latin and English, by Richard Rolle of Hampole and others, viz. 1. 'Incipiunt scripta super totam passionem Christi a quatuor euangelistis formatam editam (sic) a quodam fratre heremitarum ordinis sancti August[in]i nomine Michael de Massa': a tract on the narratives of the Passion by Michael of Massa, an Italian Augustinian, probably the same who had a papal mandate for the degree of Master of Theology at Paris, 1333. Another copy (with abridged preface) is in Add. MS. 28783, f. 56b. A French paraphrase is noticed by P. Meyer in Romania, xv, p. 174. Preface beg. 'Angeli pacis amare flebunt, Ysaie 33 cap [xxxiii. 7]: In sacra scriptura invenitur multiplex flctus'; text, 'Circa istius historiam passionis tria sunt'. Ends 'celestis fruicionis. amen. Explicit compilacio Michaelis de Massa super totam passionem Christi'. f. 1. 2. 'Incipit libellus Ricardi de Hampole heremite qui intitulatur Iudica me deus, viz. de meditati[oni]bus sanctis', &c. : a treatise, or series of tracts, similarly put together in other MSS, e. g. Burney 356, f. 65 b (the collection called Flos Florum), and Burney 359, f. 1 (see. also Horstmann, Richard Rolle and his followers, 1896, ii, p. xxxvi), but three at least of the following four parts are probably really distinct works, viz.:-(a) A letter replying to animadversions on his changing his cell and exhorting to spiritual aims. Beg. 'Iudica me deus, &c [Ps. xlii. 1]: A deo qui scrutatur cor et renes'; ends 'uitam interrumpere'. f. 16;-(b) A 'compendium' on charity and knowledge of the Scriptures, addressed to priests. Prologue beg. 'Cupienti mihi petitioni vestre satisfacere'; text, 'Quoniam igitur necesse est ut vnusquisque ad celestia'. Ends 'rapieris iubilare'. f. 19;-(c) Tract on confession, possibly continuous with the preceding. Beg. 'Istis autem dictis ad vttilitatem vestram'. f. 20;-(d) Tract on the resurrection. Beg. 'In die iudicii resurgant (sic) omnes incorruptibiles'; ends 'valeatis peruenire. amen. Explicit Iudica me deus'. f. 23. 3. 'Speculum peccatoris' (so colophon, title in a 16th cent. hand 'The glass fora sinner'): a work of doubtful authorship (cf. 7 F. XI, art. 2). Beg. 'Quoniam, karissime, diuini (sic) huius uia uite fugientis sumus'; ends 'prudenter prouideas'. A later hand adds (by mistake?) '2 a pars deest'. f. 24 b. 4. 'Speculum sacerdotis secundum visionem sancti Edwardi regis et confessoris' (so colophon): a discourse against immorality in the priesthood, doubtless composed in England. There are two brief references to Edward the Confessor's vision, and some other tales, including that of a bishop named Odo who was seen to be tormented by devils until he cursed God (cf. the English Gesta Romanorum, ed. E. E. Text Soc, 1879, no. lxv, p. 380, and Ward and Herbert, Cat. of Romances, iii, p. 258). This version of the story is particularly full and places it at Winchester. Other variants put it at Magdeburg (Magnum Speculum Exemplorum, dist. ix. 175) or Hildesheim (see 12 E. I, f. 157 b). The latter see alone had a bishop of that name (Odo of Gleichen-Reinhausen, d. 1115). Other copies of the Speculum are in Harley MSS. 2379, f. 80 b, 2388, f. 38, &c. Beg. 'Tractus (for Sanctus) Edwardus rex et confessor in extremitate positus'; ends 'recusat viuere. amen'. f. 27. 5. Thcological commonplaces, de sensibus, de custodia cordis, de temptatione, de uiciis, de penitencia, &c. Beg. 'Lucifer videns de visu in se suam formositatem'. f. 34. 6. 'Vtilis tractatus de confessione': a tract beg. 'Con. uertimini ad me in tolo corde, &c [Joel ii. 12]: Non est mirum, fratres'; ends 'vix veniam meretur'. Colophon, 'Qui scripsit carmen sit benedictus. amen'.' f. 38 b. 7. 'De horis canonicis' (so colophon): the same note as in 8 C. I, art. 7. Beg. 'Hore enim canonice propter laudem humanam'; ends 'dimittet vobis peccata vestra'. f. 40. 8. 'Hic notatur in Anglicis quomodo sacerdos (sic) quibus committitur regimen animarum debent suos parochianos in fide et mandatis dei breuiter informare' (so the Latin rubric, which begins 'Quia modernis temporibus'): an English (Southem dialect) treatise on the Deadly Sins, Commandments, Creed, and Sacraments. A few of the rubrics are in French. Beg. 'Dere frendys, ofte ze haue me bysozt that I zow wolde teche'; ends 'thedur vs bryng'. f. 41 b. 'Remedium contra omnia peccata': a brief note in Latin. Beg. 'Quando tu temptaris de aliquo peccato debes intime cogitare'. f. 45. 10. An English tract (perhaps by Richard Rolle) on the nine things best pleasing to God, &c. Three versions are printed by Horstmann (R. Rolle, i, p. 110), the nearest to the present text being from Harley MS. 1704, f. 48 b. It includes a rhyming version of the Commandments. Beg. 'Hyt was an holy man and bysouzt God'; ends 'schal neuer dye sape we alle'. 45. 11. Quatrain (Latin hexameters) on the transience of human friendship. Beg. 'Reges prelati fortunae dote beati'. f. 45 b. 12. 'Baculus viatoris' (so colophon): a dialogue between Clericulus and Bubulcus. The latter repeats in English the Lord's Prayer, Ave Maria, and Creed, together with English verse lists of the Commandments, Sins, and Works of Mercy. These, and the Sacraments, Virtues, Gifts of the Holy Ghost, and five senses, are expounded in Latin by the other. Beg. 'Peregre proficiendo itinere prelutoso nimium fatigatus' f. 54. 13. 'Secreta nature' (so colophon): a medical (gynaecological) treatise. Beg. 'Nota quod luna dicitur a Phebe secundum tabulas'. f. 51 b. 14. 'Phisoncom' (so colophon, for Physiognomicon): an extract from the Pseudo-Aristotelian Secreta Secretorum (cf 5 F. XIV, art. 5). Beg. 'Cum videris hominem in te frequentatem (sic) visum'; ends 'Ieticiam rotunditatem'. f 53. 15. Questions relating to natural philosophy, modelled on the Aristotelian Problemata. Beg. 'Quare habent quedam animalia vnctum'. f. 53b. Artt. 16 and 17 are separate pieces bound with the rest of the volume. 16. Sermon, in English, on the four ages and on seven kinds of stones. Beg.

Summa notariae by Johannes Jacobi de Bononia, a notary at Canterbury; addressed to J[ohn de Peckham] Archbishop of Canterbury (1279-1292). The dates and names are here corrupt and inconsistent.

The dates are nearly always omitted, but the letters are chiefly of 1337-1338, with several of earlier date and at least one which must be as late as 1344. Contents:. (a) 'Per regem Anglie', to Alfonso [XI], King of Castile and Leon, conceming the coming of ambassador's, n.d [27 june, 1337]. Printed in Rymers Foedera, Recorded. ii, pt. ii, p. 977. Beg.

It appears that a copy of this Great Charter was sent to the sheriffs of all the counties in England. The illustrious Ela, Countess of Salisbury, was at that time sheriff of Wiltshire (at least so tradition confidently avers), and this was the copy transmitted to her, and carefully preserved ever since her days in the abbey which she founded about four years after the date of this Great Charter. Of the Magna Charta of King John several copies are still extant; but only two copies are known to exist of the Charter of his successor Henry III, which bears date only ten years after that of Runnymede. One of these copies, which is preserved in the north of England, is defaced and wholly illegible; but the copy preserved at Lacock Abbey is perfectly clear and legible throughout, and has a seal of green wax appended to it, enclosed in a small bag of coloured silk, which six centuries have faded. The Lacock copy is therefore the only authority from which the text of this Great Charter can be correctly known; and from this copy it was printed by Blackstone, as he himself informs us. From the top of the tower there is an extensive view, especially towards the South, where the eye ranges as far as Alfred's Tower, in the park of Stour-head, about twenty-three miles distant. From the parapet wall of this building, three centuries ago, Olive Sherington, the heiress of Lacock, threw herself into the arms of her lover, a gallant gentleman of Worcestershire, John Talbot, a kinsman of the Earl of Shrewsbury. He was felled to the earth by the blow, and for a time lay lifeless, while the lady only wounded or broke her finger. Upon this, Sire Henry Sherington, her father, relented, and shortly after consented to their marriage, giving as a reason 'the step which his daughter had taken.' Unwritten tradition in many families has preserved ancient stores which border on the marvellous, and it may have embellished the tale of this lover's leap by an incident belonging to another age. For I doubt the story of the broken finger, or at least that Olive was its rightful owner. Who can tell what tragic scenes may not have passed within these walls during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries? The spectre of a nun with a bleeding finger long haunted the precincts of the abbey, and has been seen by many in former times, though I believe that her unquiet spirit is at length at rest. And I think the tale of Olive has borrowed this incident from that of a frail sister of earlier days.' [Schaaf 1660.]","",""
